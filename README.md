# My Portfolio Demo Repo
This repo is about the portfolio project students have to create as part of the Pro Dev module here at Staffordshire University. 

Below are a bunch of videos showing you how to get your project online and how to edit it. There is also a video showing how important README files are and how to get your repo social media ready. 

Good luck, any issues please get in touch.
