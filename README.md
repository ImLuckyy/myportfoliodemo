# My Portfolio Demo Repo
![Pro Dev Logo](https://github.com/shaunreeves/myportfoliodemo/blob/main/images/prodevLogo.jpg)
This repo is about the portfolio project students have to create as part of the Pro Dev module here at Staffordshire University. 

Below are a bunch of videos showing you how to get your project online and how to edit it. There is also a video showing how important README files are and how to get your repo social media ready. 

Good luck, any issues please get in touch.
